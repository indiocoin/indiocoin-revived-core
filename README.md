# Indiocoin Core
==========================
 [Windows wallet](https://github.com/inicoin/wallet-indio-qt/blob/master/indio-qt.exe/).

RPC port 22559

## What is Indiocoin? – Such coin
Indiocoin is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, although it does not use SHA256 as its proof of work (POW/POS). Taking development cues from Tenebrix and Litecoin, Indiocoin currently employs a simplified variant of scrypt.


## Development and contributions – omg developers
Development is ongoing, and the development team, as well as other volunteers, can freely work in their own trees and submit pull requests when features or bug fixes are ready.

#### Version strategy
Version numbers are following ```major.minor.patch``` semantics.

#### Branches
There are 3 types of branches in this repository:

- **master:** Stable, contains the latest version of the latest *major.minor* release.
- **maintenance:** Stable, contains the latest version of previous releases, which are still under active maintenance. Format: ```<version>-maint```
- **development:** Unstable, contains new code for planned releases. Format: ```<version>-dev```

*Master and maintenance branches are exclusively mutable by release. Planned releases will always have a development branch and pull requests should be submitted against those. Maintenance branches are there for* ***bug fixes only,*** *please submit new features against the development branch with the highest version.*

## Very Much Frequently Asked Questions

### How much indio can exist? – So many puppies!
Early 2015 (approximately a year and a half after release) there will be approximately 100,000,000,000 coins.
Each subsequent block will grant 10,000 coins to encourage miners to continue to secure the network and make up for lost wallets on hard drives/phones/lost encryption passwords/etc.

### How to get indio? – To the moon!
Indiocoin uses a simplified variant of the scrypt key derivation function as its proof of work with a target time of one minute per block and difficulty readjustment after every block. The block rewards are fixed and halve every 100,000 blocks. Starting with the 600,000th block, a permanent reward of 10,000 Indiocoin per block will be paid. 

Originally, a different payout scheme was envisioned with block rewards being determined by taking the maximum reward as per the block schedule and applying the result of a Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator to arrive at a number between 0 and the maximum reward. This was changed, starting with block 145,000, to prevent large pools from gaming the system and mining only high reward blocks. At the same time, the difficulty retargeting was also changed from four hours to once per block (every minute), implementing an algorithm courtesy of the DigiByte Coin development team, to lessen the impact of sudden increases and decreases of network hashing rate.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations, as well as new translations, can be submitted to
[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).

Periodically the translations are pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

If the changes are Indiocoin specific, they can be submitted as pull requests against this repository.
If it is a general translation, consider submitting it through upstream, as we will pull these changes later on.

Development tips and tricks
---------------------------

**compiling for debugging**

Run configure with the --enable-debug option, then make. Or run configure with
CXXFLAGS="-g -ggdb -O0" or whatever debug flags you need.

**debug.log**

If the code is behaving strangely, take a look in the debug.log file in the data directory;
error and debugging messages are written there.

The -debug=... command-line option controls debugging; running with just -debug will turn
on all categories (and give you a very large debug.log file).

The Qt code routes qDebug() output to debug.log under category "qt": run with -debug=qt
to see it.

**testnet and regtest modes**

Run with the -testnet option to run with "play indios" on the test network, if you
are testing multi-machine code that needs to operate across the internet.

If you are testing something that can run on one machine, run with the -regtest option.
In regression test mode, blocks can be created on-demand; see qa/rpc-tests/ for tests
that run in -regtest mode.

**DEBUG_LOCKORDER**

Indiocoin Core is a multithreaded application, and deadlocks or other multithreading bugs
can be very difficult to track down. Compiling with -DDEBUG_LOCKORDER (configure
CXXFLAGS="-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER -g") inserts run-time checks to keep track of which locks
are held, and adds warnings to the debug.log file if inconsistencies are detected.
